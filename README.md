# HiveController

The Idea was an Raspberry Pi as a central point with leds (ws2811), DMX-TX and enabled GPIO.
Modular over an event bus, controlled over MQTT.

GPIO-part is working, but then I switched to ESP8266-Devices. So its no longer developped and is atm an overkill, heavy, MQTT-GPIO-Interface
